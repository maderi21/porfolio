              <h2>It is really nice to see you here!</h2>
              <p>
                I enjoy building tools that are simple and working. Being a
                self-taught developer with years + experience I had plenty of
                opportunities to learn about myself as well as discipline and
                goal settings. Seems like I just started, however, I worked with
                tech-dev almost the whole of my professional life and I also had
                the notorious one class in high school. I came across web-dev in
                multiple phases of my life and would like to go through them
                with you.

                My first ever web-dev interaction was done in high school back
                in 2006 when we had to finish a project at the end of the class.
                I did like snowboarding so of course this was the project topic.
                It was a build-in-one <span className="fw-bold">text file</span>
                , no IDE as we use now. While it was a bit challenging at first,
                I enjoyed the process of building something creative, however
                cannot remember the mark from the teacher.

                When I graduated from college in 2013 I moved to Oxford -
                England. I had several jobs and this side hustle where I would
                firstly create a blog in{""}
                <span className="fw-bold">WordPress</span> - writing about
                things I love /travel/business/food/learning and then using{" "}
                <span className="fw-bold">Google AdSense</span> to monetize it.
                It went okey, but I was hungry and told I could inspire people
                and help them create their business online. So I wrote an ebook,
                which was selling on{" "}
                <span className="fw-bold">Amazon Kindle</span>, built a new
                website with coaching services used{" "}
                <span className="fw-bold">Mailchimp</span> to automate my
                marketing. Later on, I created an online course for which you
                could signup, and was all automated. For Social media I used{" "}
                {""}
                <span className="fw-bold">Hootsuite</span> to manage content.

                Inspired by a friend of mine, I have decided to learn more about
                web-dev and it was the best decision so far.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started to learn <span className="fw-bold">HTML and CSS</span>
                {""}
                first in Feb 2022 in <span className="fw-bold">CodeCademy</span>
                , then moved to <span className="fw-bold">JavaScript</span> and
                later to <span className="fw-bold">React</span>. I did few
                courses on <span className="fw-bold">Udemy</span> and then in
                Feb 2023 I was helping with an open source web3 project, where I
                would write <span className="fw-bold">Vue and Nuxt</span> code
                and got paid. It was a bit hardcore with a baby born, so I had
                to stop and work slowly on my projects. I've chosen React as my
                major framework and dove deeper. The result of my work can be
                seen on the projects page. I am also an active member of the{""}
                <span className="fw-bold">Code Beer Bratislava</span> meetup
                whenever possible and still eager to learn more.
