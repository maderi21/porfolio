              <p>
                I enjoy building tools that are simple and working.Being self
                taught developer with year + experience I had plenty of
                opportunities to learn about myself as well as discipline and
                goal settings. Seems like I just started, however I worked with
                tech-dev almost the whole of my profesional life and the
                notorious one class in high school.I came acrros web-dev
                multiple times in my life and would like to go through them with
                you.

              <p>
                My first ever web-dev interaction was done in high school back
                in 2006, when we had to finish a project at the end of the
                class. I really did like snowboarding so of course this was the
                project topic. It was whole build in one text file, I mean the
                notepad text file, no IDE as we use now.It was a bit chalange at
                first, but I enjoyed the process of building something creative
                - cannot remember the mark from teacher.

              <p>
                When I graduated college in 2013 I moved to England. I had
                several jobs and this one side hustle where I would firstly
                create a blog in <span className="fw-bold">WordPress</span> -
                writing about things I love /travel/business/food/learning and
                then using <span className="fw-bold">Google AdSense</span> to
                monetize it. It went ok, but I was hungry and told I could
                inspire people and help them create their own businesses online.
                So I wrote an ebook, which was selling on{" "}
                <span className="fw-bold">Amazon Kindle</span>, build new
                website with coaching services used{" "}
                <span className="fw-bold">Mailchimp</span> to automate my
                marketing. Later on, I created an online course for which you
                could signup for and was all automated. For Social media I used
                <span className="fw-bold">Hootsuite</span> to manage content.
