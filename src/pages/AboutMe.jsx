              <p>
                I enjoy building tools that are simple and working. Being a
                self-taught developer with years + experience I had plenty of
                opportunities to learn about myself as well as discipline and
                goal settings. Seems like I just started, however, I worked with
                tech-dev almost the whole of my professional life and the
                notorious one class in high school. I came across web-dev
                multiple times in my life and would like to go through them with
                you.

                My first ever web-dev interaction was done in high school back
                in 2006, when we had to finish a project at the end of the
                class. I really did like snowboarding so of course this was the
                project topic. It was whole build in one{" "}
                <span className="fw-bold">text file</span>, I mean the notepad
                text file, no IDE as we use now.It was a bit chalange at first,
                but I enjoyed the process of building something creative -

                When I graduated college in 2013 I moved to Oxford - England. I
                had several jobs and this one side hustle where I would firstly
                create a blog in <span className="fw-bold">WordPress</span> -
                writing about things I love /travel/business/food/learning and
                then using <span className="fw-bold">Google AdSense</span> to
                monetize it. It went ok, but I was hungry and told I could
                inspire people and help them create their own businesses online.
                So I wrote an ebook, which was selling on{" "}
                <span className="fw-bold">Amazon Kindle</span>, build new
                website with coaching services used{" "}
                <span className="fw-bold">Mailchimp</span> to automate my
                marketing. Later on, I created an online course for which you
                could signup for and was all automated. For Social media I used{" "}
                {""}
                <span className="fw-bold">Hootsuite</span> to manage content.

                Inspired by friend of mine, I have decided to learn more about
                web-dev and it was the best decision so far.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started to learn <span className="fw-bold">HTML and CSS</span>
                {""}
                first in Feb 2022 in <span className="fw-bold">CodeCademy</span>
                , then moved to <span className="fw-bold">JavaScript</span> and
                later to <span className="fw-bold">React</span>. I did few
                courses on <span className="fw-bold">Udemy</span> and then
                forwarded to Feb 2023 I was helping with open source web3
                project, where I would commit my code and actually get paid. It
                was in <span className="fw-bold">Vue and Nuxt</span>, however,
                with a baby born at home I had to stop and work slowly on my own
                projects. I choose React as my major framework and dove
                deeper.The Result of my work can be seen on projects page. I am
                also active member of {""}
                <span className="fw-bold">Code Beer Bratislava</span> meetup
                whenever possible and still eager to learn more.
